# PreviewMessageLinks

Adds a embedded message preview for message links in chat

## Features

### Interactivity

All changes done on the preview or message are synced with each other, so you can delete, reply, react, and more from the message preview itself! However, you can disable interactions on message previews in settings.

### Message Link Visibility

When a message preview is shown, the link is hidden to remove clutter. However, you can disable this feature in settings.

### Nested Message Previews

Message previews can show other message previews! After a certain depth, however, previews will be replaced by a "Maximum depth exceeded" warning that can be clicked to jump to the referenced message. The depth at which this occurs may be changed in settings.
